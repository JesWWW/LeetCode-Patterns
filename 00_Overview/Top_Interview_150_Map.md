# Top Interview 150 – Pattern-Based Classification (Complete)

This document classifies **all 150 problems** in [LeetCode Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/)

by their **primary problem-solving pattern**.

Classification rule:
- Each problem is mapped to the **first pattern you should think of**
- Classification is based on **decision-making strategy**, not data structure
- Problems that do not reduce cleanly are isolated as Special / Mixed
